# Ionic Native Http Interceptor Example

An HTTP interceptor in Ionic that seamlessly switches between native HTTP requests (using Cordova Advanced HTTP) on native devices and default HTTP requests on web browsers.

This project integrates and adapts the solution described in [An elegant way to handle native http requests with Cordova Advanced HTTP in an Ionic app](https://manuel-heidrich.dev/blog/an-elegant-way-to-handle-native-http-requests-with-cordova-advanced-http-in-an-ionic-app/) in an application that uses Ionic standalone components.

This is a fork from https://github.com/fmmagalhaes/random-country-ionic-angular

## Run
- Run in the browser with `ionic serve`
- Run in a mobile device with `ionic capacitor run`
